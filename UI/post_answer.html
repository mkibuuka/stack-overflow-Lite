                <h5>EA deleted my Origin account and EA help is totally ignoring me.</h5>

                <p>
                    I am a veteran playing Battlefield since 2002 and using origin since launch. Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to
                    my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there
                    is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling
                    that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected
                    the conversation with vague explanations. My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes
                    BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall
                    2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, etc.

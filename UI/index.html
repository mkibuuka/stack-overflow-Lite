                    I am a veteran playing Battlefield since 2002 and using origin since launch. Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to
                    my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there
                    is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling
                    that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected
                    the conversation with vague explanations. My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes
                    BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall
                    2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, etc.

                <h5>Simple resolution switching with srcset</h5>

                    Let's suppose you have three versions of an image. They all look the same except one is a smaller size or resolution intended
                    for smaller viewports, another caters for medium size viewports, and nally a larger version covers off
                    every other viewport. Here is how we can let the browser know we have these three versions available.
                    This is about as simple as things get with responsive images, so let's ensure that syntax makes perfect
                    sense.
